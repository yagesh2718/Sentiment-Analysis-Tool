# 🎭 Sentiment Analysis Tool using NLTK

This project implements a basic sentiment analysis model using the **Naive Bayes Classifier** on the **NLTK Movie Reviews** dataset. It classifies text inputs (like movie reviews) as either **positive** or **negative**, and showcases how NLP can be applied using classic machine learning methods.
